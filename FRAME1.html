<h1>Plastic pollution is a problem that the whole world is facing together. We are finding microplastic pieces in our waterways, the food we eat, and the water we drink. Collectively, we need to take action and say no to plastic.<br><br>

<br>Plastic does not biodegrade instead it slowly breaks down into smaller pieces of plastic called microplastics. It can take up to thousands of years for plastic bags to fully decompose.<br><br></br>
Plastic waste is now so prevalent in the natural environment that scientists have even suggested that it could serve as a geological indicator for our era. Today we produce about 300 million tonnes of plastic waste every year , which is nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population. This problem is on a global scale, with many root causes that need to be addressed at all levels from the individual up to the government<br><br>
Now it is up to each one of us to consciously make a decision to follow the simplest of steps in our everyday lives which will have a huge impact on the environment. Use cloth or reusable shopping bags instead of plastic bags. Avoid non-recycled plastic bottles and plastic straws. Support efforts to reduce our dependence on single use plastic. Recycle as much as possible. Buy items in bulk to reduce plastic packaging. Be informed of what is and isnâ€™t recyclable in our homes and surroundings</h1>
